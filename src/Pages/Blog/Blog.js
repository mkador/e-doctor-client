          Q-2: What is JWT, and how does it work?
        </h4>

        <p className="p-10">
          JWT,or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
          information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
          contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
          signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
          cannot be altered after the token is issued
          <br />
          Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user
          identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity of
          the token using secret salt / public key.
          <li>User sign-in using username and password or google/facebook.</li>
          <li>
            Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt
            signed using either a secret salt or a private key.
          </li>
          <li>
            User's Client uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing
            the JWT in HTTP Authorization header.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resource server then verifies the authenticity of the token using
            the secret salt/ public key.
          </li>

          Q-4: How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
        </h4>

        <p className="p-10">
          NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
          EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
          architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop
          that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener
          for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process the request without I/O
          blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and
          sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible
          to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster
          module or worker_threads module.
